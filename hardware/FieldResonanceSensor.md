# Field Resonance Sensor Module

This subsystem is designed to receive the Tesla harmonic beam output and validate the presence of field-aligned 3x, 6x, and 9x harmonic content. It is part of the feedback locking loop used to authenticate beam reception and confirm secure signal delivery.

## ðŸŽ¯ Primary Objectives

- Capture beam energy via resonant coil or tuned plate sensor
- Convert field energy to usable analog signal
- Perform spectral analysis (FFT) or amplitude threshold validation
- Trigger logic-level response if correct harmonics are detected

## ðŸ§© Electrical Block Diagram

1. **Tesla Field Collector**
   - Method: Air-wound coil or plasma-coupled plate
   - Tuned to ~333 Hz, 666 Hz, 999 Hz (Â±5 Hz)
   - Connects to amplifier frontend

2. **Low-Noise Analog Preamp**
   - OP-AMP: TL072 or equivalent
   - Band-pass filtered per harmonic band
   - Gain: 20â€“40 dB

3. **Envelope Detector**
   - Peak capture circuit or Schmitt trigger
   - Outputs to comparator logic

4. **MCU Interface**
   - ADC reads analog level
   - OR discrete GPIO if comparator used
   - Compatible with Raspberry Pi, ESP32, or STM32

## ðŸ”§ Physical Design

- Coil diameter: 3"â€“5"
- Turns: ~50 turns of 26 AWG
- Core: Air or ferromagnetic (optionally switchable)
- Enclosure: EM shielded, ventilated plastic or aluminum
- Grounding: Isolated internal loop, shield grounded separately

## ðŸ”Œ Output Behavior

| Harmonic Detected | Action |
|--------------------|--------|
| Any of 3x/6x/9x present | GPIO HIGH or UART message |
| None detected | GPIO LOW or silence |
| Invalid harmonic (non-Tesla) | No action (filtered out) |

---

## âœ… Integration Points

- Connects directly to `FeedbackLockMonitor.py`
- Optional expansion: AI-enhanced pattern recognition using FFT vector fingerprinting
- Can double as data receiver if beam carries harmonic-encoded payload (future feature)
