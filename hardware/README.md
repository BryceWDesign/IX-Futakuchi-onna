## ðŸ§© Diagram: System Hardware Overview

![Hardware Overview Diagram](./IX-Futakuchi-onna_Hardware_Overview.png)

This diagram maps all physical and electronic layers of the system, including:

- Input interface (microphone or audio DAC)
- Harmonic encoding unit (Tesla-domain logic)
- Encryption module (Gankyil phase offset)
- Field modulator (waveform generator)
- Signal obfuscation mixer (entropy layer)
- Beam emitter (Tesla coil, IR driver, or phased RF array)
- Feedback antenna (for harmonic return validation)

---

## Upcoming Hardware Subcomponents:

- Tesla Resonant Coil Array (primary emitter)
- Horus Lens Triple-Focus Collimator
- Triostrut Beam Housing Shell
- DAC/AMP Stack for Field Projection
- Real-time Field Strength Sensor
- Thermal & EM Shielding Layouts

---

All hardware diagrams will conform to real-world electrical safety standards and be buildable using available components, without reliance on speculative materials or non-physical structures.

More files coming soon.
