IX-Futakuchi-onna : Decodes received obfuscated harmonic waveform into original beam pattern
Author: Bryce Wooster
License: See LICENSE in root

Description:
Applies inverse transformations to restore the original harmonic signal,
assuming it was scrambled via SignalObfuscatorV2 with known key properties.
Performs:
- Spectral de-smearing
- Phase de-scrambling
- Signal normalization

Use this on received field returns before downstream analysis or lock validation.
