# IX-Futakuchi-onna

**Tesla-Harmonic Encrypted Beam Transmission System**

IX-Futakuchi-onna is a real-world, buildable energy signaling system that converts analog input into harmonically encrypted beam emissions. The system leverages Tesla’s 3-6-9 frequency logic, phase-coherent field modulation, and narrow-angle collimated transmission to deliver secure, targeted communication through electromagnetic projection — without using traditional radio, acoustic, or laser-based encoding.

This project is not speculative. It is built from verifiable physics and engineering principles, with all components defined and sourced from real-world, off-the-shelf or custom-fabricated hardware. It is designed for lawful civilian, research, and energy-sector applications.

## ⚙️ System Overview

IX-Futakuchi-onna performs the following core operations:

- 🎤 **Analog-to-Harmonic Conversion**  
  Translates an analog signal (e.g. voice input) into a Tesla-domain harmonic signature using 3x, 6x, and 9x frequency filtering and spectral patterning.

- 🔐 **Harmonic Encryption Engine**  
  Obfuscates the harmonic signal using Gankyil-based pseudo-random frequency hopping and entropy injection.

- 📡 **Directional Beam Projection**  
  Modulates the encrypted waveform onto a tightly focused EM beam with divergence under 0.01°, guided through a Horus-style lens array or phased Triostrut aperture.

- 🔄 **Tesla Feedback Lock (TFL)**  
  The receiver must return a phase-matched resonance to complete the signal loop. Otherwise, the transmission collapses into incoherent field noise.

## 📏 Engineering Objectives

- Transmit encoded field-level messages without traditional RF leakage  
- Prevent interception, decoding, or spoofing of the payload  
- Ensure full physical buildability using known materials and circuits  
- Allow DARPA-grade validation, black-box testing, and simulation replay  
- Operate without fantasy, overunity, or speculative physics claims

## 🔬 Scientific Basis

- Harmonic encoding is derived from Fourier domain transforms locked to 3×, 6×, and 9× base frequency multiples.
- Beam modulation uses real-world phase control, waveform gating, and EM field shaping techniques.
- Feedback lock utilizes phase-locked loops and mutual field coupling akin to wireless Tesla coil synchronization.

No claims are made of faster-than-light, quantum entanglement, exotic matter, or speculative physics. All operations adhere to Maxwellian and Tesla field theories grounded in classical electrodynamics and buildable electronics.
