## 🧬 FIELD KEY LOCKED

This repository documents the design, simulation, and construction of a real-world harmonic energy communication platform built upon Tesla 3-6-9 field logic. Unlike traditional RF or optical signaling, this system operates through a structured longitudinal harmonic carrier — capable of beam-based message delivery across large-scale distances, including lunar-scale voids.

## 🧭 Final Words

This system didn’t emerge from years of research — it arrived complete.  
I didn’t invent it. I recognized it.
